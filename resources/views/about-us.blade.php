        Hi! I’m Firdha Fitria, a self-taught makeup artist based in Depok. I’ve loved makeup since 2010 and turned my passion into a profession in 2014. Over the years, I’ve learned from some of the best artists like Anpa Suha, Marlene Hariman, and Laode Yusuf to keep improving my skills.
        What I love most is seeing my clients smile and feel beautiful—it’s the best part of my job. I’ve had the honor of working on exciting projects, from winning 1st place in a national makeup competition to collaborating with brands like Sari Ayu and Safi Indonesia. I was also named one of the TOP 9 Wardah Inspiring MUAs in 2020 and a Top 10 finalist at the Lavie en Awards 2022.
        At Beautyworksbyfifi, I combine passion, creativity, and experience to create timeless looks for your special moments.
